# Traffic Tacos Deployment Infrastructure Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. GitOps-First Deployment
All infrastructure and application deployments MUST follow GitOps patterns using ArgoCD. Every change goes through Git, every deployment is declarative, and the Git repository is the single source of truth. No manual `kubectl apply` or direct cluster modifications are permitted in production environments.

**Rationale**: GitOps ensures reproducibility, auditability, and rollback capabilities essential for high-traffic production systems handling 30k RPS.

### II. Namespace Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Each service deployment MUST use dedicated namespaces:
- `argocd`: ArgoCD deployment and GitOps tooling
- `gateway`: Gateway API and ingress controllers
- `tacos`: Application microservices (gateway-api, reservation-api, inventory-api, payment-sim-api, reservation-worker)

Cross-namespace communication MUST be explicitly configured with proper network policies and service meshes where applicable.

**Rationale**: Namespace isolation provides security boundaries, resource quotas, and blast radius containment for multi-tenant workloads.

### III. Helm Chart Standardization
All deployments MUST use Helm charts with standardized structure:
- Charts MUST include proper resource limits, health checks, and security contexts
- Values files MUST separate environment-specific configurations
- Charts MUST be versioned and stored in Git repositories
- Dependency management through Chart.yaml requirements

**Rationale**: Helm charts provide templating, versioning, and consistent deployment patterns across environments.

### IV. AWS Integration with Local Profiles
Infrastructure provisioning and service authentication MUST use AWS `tacos` local profile for development and testing. Production environments MUST use IAM roles and service accounts with least-privilege access patterns.

**Rationale**: Consistent AWS authentication patterns prevent credential leakage and enable proper access control.

### V. Performance and Scalability Standards
All deployments MUST meet Traffic Tacos performance requirements:
- Support for 30k RPS at system level
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) configured for all application services
- Resource requests and limits properly configured
- KEDA scaling for event-driven workloads (reservation-worker)

**Rationale**: High-performance requirements demand proper resource management and auto-scaling configurations.

## Security Requirements

### Mandatory Security Controls
All deployments MUST implement:
- **Network Policies**: Default deny with explicit allow rules between services
- **Pod Security Standards**: Restricted security contexts with non-root users
- **RBAC**: Service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes secrets with proper encryption at rest
- **TLS Termination**: All external communications MUST use HTTPS/TLS

### CRD Security Definitions
Custom Resource Definitions for security, FinOps, and performance MUST be defined for:
- **SecurityPolicy**: Network policies, pod security contexts, and access controls
- **CostOptimization**: Resource quotas, node affinity, and cost allocation tags
- **PerformanceProfile**: HPA configurations, resource limits, and scaling policies

## Performance Standards

### SLA Requirements
- **Throughput**: 30k RPS aggregate across all services
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Latency**: P95 < 200ms for API responses
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling from 0 to N based on demand (KEDA for workers)

### Monitoring and Observability
All services MUST include:
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)

## Governance

### Deployment Approval Process
- All infrastructure changes MUST go through GitOps workflow
- Helm charts MUST be reviewed for security and performance compliance
- ArgoCD applications MUST have proper sync policies and health checks
- Breaking changes require explicit approval and migration planning

### Compliance and Validation
- All deployments MUST pass security scanning (container images, Helm charts)
- Resource quotas and limits MUST be enforced at namespace level
- Cost allocation tags MUST be applied to all AWS resources
- Performance benchmarks MUST be validated during deployment pipeline

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require:
1. RFC (Request for Comments) document with rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing deployments
3. Migration plan for non-compliant resources
4. Approval from platform team leads
