## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Development and operations teams need a comprehensive deployment system for Traffic Tacos microservices that meets 30k RPS performance requirements while maintaining security compliance and cost optimization. The system should automatically scale applications based on demand, enforce security policies, and provide cost visibility across all deployments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** all microservices are deployed in the tacos namespace, **When** external traffic reaches 30k RPS, **Then** applications automatically scale to handle the load without service degradation
2. **Given** security policies are defined for the platform, **When** applications are deployed, **Then** all services run with restricted security contexts and proper network isolation
3. **Given** cost optimization is enabled, **When** applications are running, **Then** resource utilization is monitored and cost allocation tags are properly applied to track expenses
4. **Given** reservation-worker processes background jobs, **When** SQS queue depth increases, **Then** KEDA automatically scales worker pods from 0 to N based on demand
5. **Given** a service deployment fails, **When** GitOps detects the issue, **Then** the system automatically rolls back to the previous stable version
6. **Given** multiple environments require different configurations, **When** applications are deployed, **Then** environment-specific values are applied without manual intervention

### Edge Cases
- What happens when auto-scaling reaches maximum pod limits during traffic spikes?
- How does the system handle persistent volume claims when pods are rescheduled?
- What occurs when security policies conflict with application requirements?
- How are database connections managed during rapid scaling events?
- What happens when cost budgets are exceeded during peak traffic periods?
- How does the system handle inter-service communication during partial deployments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Application Deployment
- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy all Traffic Tacos microservices (gateway-api, reservation-api, inventory-api, payment-sim-api, reservation-worker) in the dedicated tacos namespace
- **FR-002**: System MUST support independent versioning and deployment of each microservice
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for all deployed applications
- **FR-004**: System MUST support rolling updates with zero-downtime deployments
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable environment-specific configuration through values files and secrets

#### Performance and Scalability (30k RPS)
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically scale applications to handle 30k RPS aggregate traffic load
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST support KEDA-based scaling for reservation-worker based on SQS queue depth
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain response time targets (P95 < 200ms) under full load conditions
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide resource requests and limits for optimal pod scheduling and resource utilization

#### Security Requirements
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce Pod Security Standards with restricted security contexts for all applications
