## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT traffic management capabilities teams need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific manifests, ingress controllers)
- üë• Written for platform engineers and application development teams

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Platform engineers need a modern Gateway API system to manage ingress traffic, SSL/TLS termination, and intelligent routing for Traffic Tacos microservices. The system should handle 30k RPS traffic, provide path-based and host-based routing, and integrate with AWS Load Balancer Controller for EKS environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Gateway API is deployed in the gateway namespace, **When** external traffic reaches the cluster, **Then** requests are properly routed to appropriate backend services based on path and host rules
2. **Given** multiple microservices require external access, **When** HTTP routes are configured through Gateway API, **Then** each service receives traffic on its designated path with proper load balancing
3. **Given** SSL certificates are required for secure communication, **When** Gateway API manages TLS termination, **Then** all external traffic is encrypted and certificates are automatically managed
4. **Given** traffic patterns change during peak usage, **When** the Gateway API handles 30k RPS load, **Then** requests are distributed efficiently without service degradation
5. **Given** a backend service becomes unavailable, **When** health checks detect the failure, **Then** traffic is automatically rerouted to healthy instances

### Edge Cases
- What happens when SSL certificate renewal fails during high traffic periods?
- How does the system handle malformed requests or potential security threats?
- What occurs when backend services are temporarily overloaded or unresponsive?
- How are cross-origin requests (CORS) managed for web applications?
- What happens when Gateway API configuration conflicts with existing ingress resources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy Gateway API controllers and CRDs in the dedicated gateway namespace
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide HTTP and HTTPS ingress capabilities for external traffic access
- **FR-003**: System MUST support path-based routing to direct traffic to specific microservices (reservation-api, inventory-api, payment-sim-api, gateway-api)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support host-based routing for different subdomains or environments
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle SSL/TLS termination with automatic certificate management
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with AWS Load Balancer Controller for EKS environments
- **FR-007**: System MUST support traffic splitting and canary deployments for gradual rollouts
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide health check capabilities for backend service monitoring
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cross-namespace routing to services in the tacos namespace
- **FR-010**: System MUST support rate limiting and traffic shaping policies
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain high availability during backend service updates or failures
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide observability through metrics, logging, and distributed tracing
- **FR-013**: System MUST support WebSocket connections for real-time communication features
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle 30k RPS aggregate traffic load with proper load distribution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Gateway Class**: Defines the type of Gateway controller and its configuration policies
- **Gateway**: Represents a load balancer instance with listeners for different protocols and ports
- **HTTP Route**: Defines routing rules, path matching, and backend service mapping
- **Backend Service**: Target microservice endpoints that receive routed traffic
- **TLS Certificate**: SSL certificates for secure communication, managed automatically or manually
- **Route Policy**: Traffic management rules including rate limiting, retries, and timeouts
