## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT operations teams need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific manifests, deployment commands)
- üë• Written for platform engineers and DevOps stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Platform engineers need a centralized GitOps system to manage deployments of Traffic Tacos microservices across multiple namespaces in the EKS cluster. The system should automatically sync applications from Git repositories, provide deployment visibility, and enable controlled rollbacks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** ArgoCD is deployed in the argocd namespace, **When** a platform engineer accesses the ArgoCD UI, **Then** they can view all managed applications and their sync status
2. **Given** a Git repository contains Helm charts for applications, **When** ArgoCD is configured to monitor the repository, **Then** applications are automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch
3. **Given** an application deployment fails, **When** a platform engineer views the ArgoCD dashboard, **Then** they can see detailed error messages and rollback to the previous working version
4. **Given** multiple namespaces require application deployments, **When** ArgoCD manages cross-namespace applications, **Then** each application deploys to its designated namespace with proper isolation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Git repository becomes unavailable during sync operations?
- How does the system handle conflicting manual kubectl changes vs. GitOps-managed resources?
- What occurs when Helm chart dependencies fail to resolve during deployment?
- How are secrets and sensitive configurations handled in GitOps workflows?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy ArgoCD server and supporting components in the dedicated argocd namespace
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide web-based UI for viewing application status, sync history, and deployment logs
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically sync applications from Git repositories based on configurable intervals
- **FR-004**: System MUST support Helm chart deployments with values file management
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable manual sync triggers and rollback operations through the UI
- **FR-006**: System MUST manage applications across multiple namespaces (argocd, gateway, tacos)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide RBAC integration with EKS cluster authentication
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect and report configuration drift between Git state and cluster state
- **FR-009**: System MUST support application dependency management and ordered deployments
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all deployment and configuration changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with existing EKS cluster without disrupting running workloads
- **FR-012**: System MUST support secure storage and injection of sensitive configuration data

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ArgoCD Application**: Represents a deployed microservice with source repository, target namespace, and sync policies
- **Git Repository**: Source of truth containing Helm charts, manifests, and configuration files
- **Sync Policy**: Rules defining how and when applications should be synchronized from Git to cluster
- **Application Project**: Groups related applications with shared access policies and resource restrictions
- **Repository Credentials**: Secure storage for Git access tokens and SSH keys required for repository access
